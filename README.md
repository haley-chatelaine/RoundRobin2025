# RoundRobin2025
Code used for analyses of Round Robin data

All input data is included in the "data" subfolder. The data is further subdivided according to the type of code it is used for. For example, the "original_input" subfolder is used as input data for the initial data wrangling and cleanup in "01_dataPre_and_labSummaries.Rmd." All data and subfolders are referenced when loading in each Rmd.

The code folder includes all functions and processing script files. If files are run in order according to the prepending number, the analysis will be replicated.

The outputs folder includes all outputs from the code. It can be deleted and re-run or a new folder created to replicate results.
